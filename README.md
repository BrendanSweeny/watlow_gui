The goal of this project is to develop a GUI for computer controlling Watlow
EZ-Zone PM3 temperature controllers. An unofficial LabView driver exists, but
there does not appear to be an open-source driver for situations where LabView is
not available or suitable.

This project operates with the Watlow controllers belonging to one of two 'zones'
responsible for either heating or cooling
